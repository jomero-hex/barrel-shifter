# Multi-Function Barrel Shifter using 8/16/32 Bits

## Description:

Consider an 8-bit shifting circuit that can perform a rotating-right or a rotating-left operation. An
additional 1-bit control signal, use lr to specifie the desired direction.

1. Design the circuit using one rotate-right circuit, one rotate-left circuit, and one 2-to-1
multiplexer to select the desired result. Derive the code.

2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code.

3. Synthesize the circuit, program the FPGA, and verify its operation.

4. Check the report files and compare the number of logic cells and propagation delays of
the two designs.

5. Expand the code for a 16-bit circuit and synthesize the code. Repeat steps 1 to 5.

6. Expand the code for a 32-bit circuit and synthesize the code. Repeat steps 1 to 5.
